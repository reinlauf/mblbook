This is a ELN mobile for every developer of anythink he want.

Here I test the Git-Hub subversion system.
I want to find a new Job in programming.

It's a joke that there are no programmers in Germany - there are only none that can do anything.
If anyone wants, I tell the joke of the men's department store - he says it all.
